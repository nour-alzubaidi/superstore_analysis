## Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail superstore dataset to evaluate sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and discount impact.
The goal is to generate business-driven insights that support strategic decision-making using Excel, SQL Server, Python (EDA), and Power BI.

## Objectives

* Analyze overall sales and profit performance

* Identify top-performing and loss-making products

* Evaluate the impact of discounts on profitability

* Understand sales trends over time

* Compare performance across categories, regions, and customer segments

## Tools and Technology

* Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing

* SQL Server – Data querying and KPI analysis

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Power BI – Interactive dashboards and data visualization

## Dataset

* Source: Superstore sales dataset

* Records include:
  * Orders, customers, products
  * Sales, profit, discount
  * Category, region, segment
  * Order date

## Data Cleaning(Excel)

* Standardized date formats

* Converted discount to decimal format

* Ensured numeric consistency for sales and profit

* Saved cleaned data as Excel file for downstream analysis

## SQL Analysis
Key metrics and analyses performed:

* Total sales, total profit, total orders

* Average order value

* Sales and profit by category and sub-category

* Regional and state-level performance

* Time-based analysis (yearly and monthly trends)

* Discount impact on profit

* Top 10 profitable products

* Top 10 loss-making products

## Exploratory Data Analysis(Python)
EDA focused on:

* Sales and profit distributions

* Trend analysis over time

* Discount vs profit relationship

* Category and segment performance

* Identification of outliers and loss drivers

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard consists of two pages:
### Page 1 - Executive Overview

* KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, Average Order Value

* Sales trend over time

* Sales and profit by category

* Profit by region

* Interactive filters (Year, Category, Region, Segment)

### Page 2 - Detailed Analysis

* Discount impact on profit

* Top 10 profitable products

* Top 10 loss-making products

* Sales and profit by customer segment

## Key Insights

* Sales show consistent growth over time, indicating strong business expansion

* Technology category leads in both sales and profit

* High discounts are strongly associated with lower or negative profit

* Several products consistently generate losses and require pricing or discount review

* Consumer segment contributes the highest sales and profit

* Central region is the most profitable region

## Business Recommendations

* Reduce excessive discounting, especially on low-margin products

* Focus marketing and inventory on high-profit products

* Re-evaluate or discontinue consistently loss-making products

* Strengthen operations in high-performing regions

* Optimize pricing strategies for Furniture category
